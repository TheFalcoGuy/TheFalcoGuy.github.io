## Risks associated with suited Extra-Vehicular Activities (EVAs)

<details>
<summary><strong>Identified Risk:</strong> High CO2 emissions within a confined space suit</summary>

<p><strong>Identified Primary Cause:</strong> High exertion activities including, but not limited to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Transfer operations (moving from point A to point B)</li>
  <li>Post-Fall Recoveries</li>
  <li>Bracing and bearing the mass/inertia of the body and space suit</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Astronauts exert high torques to overcome space suit pressure and mass to achieve specific work tasks</em></p>

<details>
<summary><strong>Identified Risk:</strong> Astronauts falling during space walk</summary>

<p><strong>Identified Primary Cause:</strong> Handling of external environment including, but not limited to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Gait instability</li>
  <li>Limited range of motion</li>
  <li>Slipping</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Astronaut falls must be treated like elderly falling, <strong>falls can result in catastrophic failures</strong></em></p>

These risks are unaddressed and no comparable safety countermeasures have been proven.
