## Overview

This study investigates the use case of incorporating Supernumerary Robotic Limbs (known as SuperLimbs) as an assistive device for astronaut performing an EVA in a micro-gravity environment (in this case, an EVA at the International Space Station). The SuperLimbs grab handrails fixed to the outside of a space vehicle to securely hold the astronaut body. The astronaut can use both hands for performing an EVA task, rather than using one hand for securing the body or operating a tether. The SuperLimbs can also assist an astronaut in repositioning the body and stabilizing it during an EVA mission. A control algorithm based on Admittance Control is developed for a: virtually reducing the inertial load of the entire body so that an astronaut can reposition his/her body with reduced effort, and b: bracing the body stably despite reaction forces and disturbances acting on the astronaut during an EVA operation. A full-scale prototype of Space Suit SuperLimbs was constructed and tested. Results from the experimentation indicated that with the aid of SuperLimbs, energy consumption during EVAs is reduced significantly.
