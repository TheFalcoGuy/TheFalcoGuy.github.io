## About This Project

This website documents the research and development of Supernumerary Robotic Limbs (SuperLimbs) for next-generation space suit technology. The project is led by Erik Ballesteros, a Ph.D. candidate at MIT's d'Arbeloff Robotics Laboratory, under the supervision of Dr. Harry H. Asada.

## Research Focus

Our research focuses on developing wearable robotic appendages to augment astronauts during Extra-Vehicular Activities (EVAs). SuperLimbs aim to:

- **Enhance astronaut safety** through fall protection, prevention, and recovery
- **Improve astronaut productivity** by providing stable body support during task execution
- **Bolster astronaut comfort** by reducing metabolic workload and improving ergonomics
